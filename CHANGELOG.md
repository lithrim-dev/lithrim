## [0.1.0-ce] — Unreleased

First public Community Edition release.

### Added
- The deterministic **grounding floor** + in-process **council**, with
  by-construction labeling and an audit spine.
- `make demo` — a $0, offline, no-key, no-pack replay that shows the floor flip a
  council `PASS` to `BLOCK` on a neutral fabricated-claim case.
- Neutral open packs: `_core` (generic content review) and `support_ticket_qa`
  (both `tier: core`), plus the plugin / connector (MCP) interface.
- A synthetic clinical sample pack (`clinical_scribe`, `tier: core`) — a by-construction
  teaser of the ambient-scribe note-review domain (missing allergy, wrong dosage, fabricated
  history, negation reversal, diagnosis upcoding, + a clean negative). Synthetic, not the
  curated Pro `healthcare` pack.
- BYOK single-provider live grading (OpenAI / Azure OpenAI).
- Release scaffolding: an honest README with an explicit limits section,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, a credential-free CI
  workflow, and issue / PR templates.

### Notes
- The full clinical `healthcare` domain pack is **distributed separately**; a
  fresh clone is clinical-free and boots on the neutral `_core` pack.
- **Not a medical device, not clinically validated** — see the README "Intended
  use & safety" note. All bundled sample data is synthetic (Synthea).
